We all share the need to cook for survival, and many of us experience the same daily issues: what food do I have and what should I make? Our app is a tool inspired by one of our team member's mother, who constantly spends time taking inventory of what's in the fridge and pantry. The app aims to resolve decision paralysis and provide a simpler solution to managing your food.

The app consists of two core elements: pantry management and recipe discovery. Users will be able to easily adjust and record what ingredients they have at home, organized by types including produce, meat, dairy, spices, and more. Based on their current inventory, users are able to search and filter through matching recipes. Completing a recipe will automatically subtract the used ingredients by quantity from the pantry. Users will also be able to save recipes and record created recipes in a cooking journal, including a picture of their dish.

Our app provides organization and utilities to those of us who struggle to keep track of meals and planning. The easy-to-access digital pantry helps users prevent food that gets lost in the back of their fridge from going bad. Suggested recipes with step-by-step instructions eliminate the time spent planning and debating what's for dinner, making meal prep a more enjoyable experience.
